Hello, World program refers to the output of "Hello, World!" on the computer screen (meaning "Hello, the world!") The computer program for this string of strings. In general, this is the most basic and simplest program in every computer programming language, and is usually the first program written by a beginner. It can also be used to determine the compiler of the language, the development environment of the program, and whether the running environment is installed properly.

The output string "Hello World" as the first demonstration program has now become a tradition of programming language learning. The "Hello World" demonstration program was first built in 1972 by Baer laboratory member Brian Collingham's internal technical document "A Tutorial Introduction to the Language B". Soon in 1974, written by "Programming in C: A Tutorial", also used this example; and Brian Colin and Denis Ricci to rewrite this document as "C programming language" has retained this demonstration program, then widely circulated. - quoted in "Wikipedia"

Then, the first use of personal blog, still can not be separated from the most familiar.
